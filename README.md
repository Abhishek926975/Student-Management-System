📘 Student Management System in C

The Student Management System (SMS) is a simple, menu-driven application written in the C programming language. It is designed to help beginners understand how to build a structured program that manages records efficiently. This project showcases the use of structures, arrays, string handling, and basic input/output functions to create a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system.

🚀 Features

Add Student – Users can add new students by entering details such as roll number, name, age, and course. Each student record is stored in memory using an array of structures.

View Students – Displays a list of all stored student records in a clean and organized format.

Search Student – Allows searching for a student by roll number. If the student exists, their details are shown instantly.

Update Student – Provides an option to edit existing student information, such as name, age, or course.

Delete Student – Removes a student record from the system by roll number, ensuring the array is updated properly.

Exit – Terminates the program safely when the user chooses to quit.

🛠️ Technologies Used

C Programming Language – Core logic and implementation.

Structures – For defining and grouping student attributes.

Arrays – To store multiple student records.

Standard I/O Functions – For user input and output handling.

🎯 Purpose

The main purpose of this project is educational. It is particularly useful for students and beginners who are learning C programming. By working on this project, learners can:
